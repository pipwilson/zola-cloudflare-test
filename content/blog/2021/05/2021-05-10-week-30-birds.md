These are the birds I regularly see in my garden:

  * blackbirds
  * goldfinches
  * pigeons
  * collared doves
  * sparrows
  * robins
  * blue tits
  * great tits

Very very occassionally we get a jay and a greenfinch. This all feels quite varied until you read the RSPB list of common garden birds:

    The most likely visitors to your garden are starlings, house sparrows, blackbirds, blue and great tits, robins, greenfinches and collared doves.
