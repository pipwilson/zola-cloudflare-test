I moved house. That&#8217;s it, that&#8217;s the update.

The good thing is that I now have [a fiber-to-the-premises internet connection][1], which means it is nice and fast, and wasn&#8217;t an option at my last house. It does mean I had to hand back my TiVo box (because we can&#8217;t get Virgin Media), so I am PVR-less for the first time in a couple of decades, but with the rise in streaming services maybe I don&#8217;t need it any more? Time will tell for sure, but the options on the market all look a bit crap (presumably because those streaming services have eaten their market).

The bad news is being surrounded by cardboard boxes all the time in every room. Seriously. You&#8217;d think there&#8217;d be a good opportunity to build a box fort, but if it collapses there&#8217;s a real danger of being hit in the head by a misfiled frying pan, Tex Avery style.

Hopefully after a bit more unpacking I can get back to hacking on some code again. That would be nice.
