  * I learned this week that there is such a thing as <a href="https://earthsky.org/earth/the-undark-nights-of-summer-guy-ottewell/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://earthsky.org/earth/the-undark-nights-of-summer-guy-ottewell/">astronomical twilight and astronomical night</a>, and that during the peak of summer because of the tilt of the earth, we only get to the twilight in the UK. There is [an awesome visualisation of this on Clear Outside][1]. I learned this because now I love next to a field so I am eyeing up a telescope for late night stargazing.

  * I ripped the hell out of my back again. Limping, slow walks, stretches and nurofen are in order.

  * The family were all on half term and so I got some time in the house alone when they went off to visit relatives. Just as I was starting to get used to it, they returned.

  * The return of the family meant the return of The Lunchbox Tyranny &#8211; the nightly Making of Sandwiches that strikes fear and dread into everyone who thinks they&#8217;ve done all their chores and can safely go to bed.
