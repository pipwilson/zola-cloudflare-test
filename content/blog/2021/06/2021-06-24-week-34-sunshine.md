  * It has been hot and sunny! Hurrah! At last a break from the rain and cold and a chance to get outside, take a deep breath and relax.

  * My son no longer has time/energy to go to Scouts in the evening but before we quit officially I want to go back through his Beavers, Cubs and Scouts Facebook group and download the photos with him in (the kids aren’t tagged). It seems that the only way to do this is manually. This is going to take a looooong time.
  * We need to buy a new mattress and so subscribed to [Which?][1]. It turns out to be not only extremely well written (the language used is clear, simple, authoritative), but there’s way more material on their site than I’d expected. We’ll only subscribe for a month or so as we kit out the house, but I’ll definitely return in the future when we want to make other expensive purchases.
  * I tried to ride my road bike through a field. This was not a good idea, and it became an even worse one when I hit some hidden rocks and came off. Don’t do it kids &#8211; just say no!
  * I am very much looking forward to more sunshine, and getting out on my bike &#8211; but on safe roads and cycle paths this time.
