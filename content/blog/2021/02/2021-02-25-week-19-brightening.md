  * There is blossom on trees!
  * There are primroses in the garden! At last, life!
  * I am making very, very slow progress in getting my blog moved over to Zola. Maybe an hour a week is not enough?
  * I hit 1000 continuous days of entries to [Daylio][1]. It has worked perfectly as a sort of daily personal blog, and I think I’ll have to explore the options for exporting the data (they permit CSV export) and seeing what kind of form I can get it into. There are also [plenty of projects on Github that seem to use the data][2], so I’ll take a look at those too.
  * I am watching S3 of The Original Series of Star Trek. Somehow, I don’t think I’ve ever seen it before. It is v relaxing.
