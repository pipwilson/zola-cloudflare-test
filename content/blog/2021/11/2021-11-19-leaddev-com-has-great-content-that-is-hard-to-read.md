I really like a lot of the content on <https://leaddev.com/> &#8211; ranging from simple advice for new tech leaders to insightful ideas for veterans, it is worth getting on their mailing list by using the signup box at the bottom of every page.

But.

Every article I read, I read using [Firefox&#8217;s Reader View][1] in order to move the text to the left or centre of the screen instead of the right. I have tried to read it as the designers intended, honestly I have, but I find it uncomfortable, distracting and annoying. I actually went to override the CSS or find an extension to change the layout before I remembered about reader view and finally managed to read their content in comfort.

Please, leaddev.com, stop having a novel design, and have a good one instead.
