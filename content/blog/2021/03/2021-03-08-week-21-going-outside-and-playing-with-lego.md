  * Because it’s so much warmer, and the evenings are so much longer, I managed to get out of the house more than once during the week instead of just walking between a single-digit number of rooms. Novel! I even got out on my bike, which was a massive relief &#8211; more of this to come I hope.
  * In a break from getting killed by Theseus and the Minotaur in Hades, I have picked up [Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2][1] again, which I think I haven’t played for 18 months because I got bored, but it serves as a nice, mindless plod forward with some fun parts (Asgardians do also not know what [covfefe][2] is, assuming it to be a Midgardian beverage). The Season Pass with a load of add-on packs was on sale for £3 so I picked up that, and now I can be Thanos and remake the universe as I see fit. Wonderful.
  * The kids are back to school next week, and although the schools will also being doing them, we are also now equipped with our own lateral flow tests. What joy!
  * This also means that I will be back to being on my own in the house during the day whilst working from home &#8211; because I left my last job at the end of Feb 2020, not starting the next until May 21, it also means it’s now been more than 12 months since I last had a workplace other than my living room.
  * I am slowly plodding my way through [Kim Stanley Robinson’s 2312][3]. I think it thinks it’s avant-garde in some way, but it already feels anachronistic, and I’m really struggling to get through it, but my kindle tells me I’m at 80% so I’ll stick it out to the end.
  * I bullied my daughter into completing the [Lego Hidden Side set][4] she’s had half-built in the living room since last summer, which she completely resented until she’d finished and then had a great time using the app to hunt the ghosts and be hunted herself (although we did have to turn the “creepy” music off!”).&nbsp;
