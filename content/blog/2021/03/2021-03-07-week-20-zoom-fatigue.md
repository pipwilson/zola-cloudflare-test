  * This has felt like a long week.
  * I realised that I am having a day off work roughly every 7 weeks with a thundering headache, inability to focus and incredibly short temper &#8211; my wife is placing her bets on some kind of Zoom Fatigue, which sounds not totally implausible &#8211; Anadin Extra only takes the edge off it and it takes a day or two before I’m back to normal again.
  * The project I’m on at work won an award for [best collaboration in the Civil Service this year][1]. That was nice!
