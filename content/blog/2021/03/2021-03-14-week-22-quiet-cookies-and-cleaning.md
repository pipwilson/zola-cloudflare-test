  * The family went back to school this week and so my working days were once again quiet, which is very nice (although it does also mean I’m going to have to start buying petrol for the car again, in order to do the school run, which I haven’t had to do for months on end)
  * [I don’t care about cookies][1]. Not any more. Or at least, I don’t care about the horrible, intrusive cookie popups that so many websites have implemented. Just stop using the bloody cookies! You’re probably measuring the wrong thing anyway, so just stop it! Obviously an extension like this, with unlimited scope to look at all my browsing needs more than just a quick click of the install button, in order to see what it’s actually doing, but I am totally done with these popups.
  * Wednesday was a day off work in order to clean the house to prepare for selling the house. Again. MEGA GLARE.
  * I subscribe to [the NASA space station feed][2], but they post really frequently, and so I often don&#8217;t read it. I guess the thing about the future is that if you wait long enough, it comes to you.
  * Why are there so many newsletters in 2021? Why has the email inbox become the new feed reader? Is this because Slack etc. has displaced the activity from email, and so people are now more willing to engage with their inboxes? What on earth did we do to deserve this particular hellscape?
  * We watched WandaVision. It was &#8230; OK? Not as engaging as The Mandalorian.
  * We have also been watching [Superstore][3]. A show about the same people interacting within (mostly) the same four walls, day in, day out. Feels about right for this timeline.
  * As you may be able to tell from the general tone of the above, my family and I are all exhausted. EXHAUSTED. We have a notice board in the house and have started writing up places to visit once we’re allowed. Place #1 is Stonehenge. For the majority of my life I have lived within an hour’s drive of it, but never visited. I think I should fix this. Here’s to a henge-tastic future!
