After finishing a year-long stint working for the Government Digital Service to [deliver support to people during the worst of the pandemic][1], I took a month off.<figure class="wp-block-image size-medium">

This meant that I didn&#8217;t turn on a computer for most of that time, and certainly didn&#8217;t feel inclined to blog. A month ago I started working at [Kaluza][3] (lured in by [Ovo&#8217;s Plan Zero][4] approach to the climate crisis), and having just about got my head around what I need to do there, I have brain space to write words again.

With three jobs in three years, I&#8217;ve come to realise how much harder it is to reflect on my year-on-year personal development without an explicit checkpoint with a consistent third-party. Not only that, but I don&#8217;t do what I tell the people I manage to do and keep a weekly log of successes or problems I&#8217;ve overcome. This makes it much harder to keep a good perspective over time on how I think I&#8217;m doing, and how I develop in a role at a new company. 

Making sure I do keep a record of achievements each week is something I&#8217;ll have to do pretty much immediately, probably through setting aside some time each Friday morning to ask myself the scrum standup questions at a slightly more abstract level. This should also help keep me honest when prioritising my daily work as well. I&#8217;ll probably use the [Inkdrop Note Templates][5] plugin to set up a standard way of doing this. Wish me luck ðŸ™‚
