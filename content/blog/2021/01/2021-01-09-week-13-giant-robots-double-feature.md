Welcome to space year 2021! A bumper issue this week because I missed last week due to \*gestures all around\* all this.

  * Our favourite Christmas presents were an [Entry Grade Gundam][1], a plush narwhal and a burrito blanket.
  * We watched the [despecialised version of the original Star Wars trilogy][2] and enjoyed it a huge amount. I don’t think we’ll bother with the pre and sequels.
  * On Christmas day the kids read out a story they&#8217;d written for us, which was pretty adorable.
  * I heinously pulled a muscle in my back, leading to rather less engagement with the Christmas season than normal, and leading to much screaming in the middle of the night.
  * It has pretended to snow several times, but not actually done it &#8211; disappointing!
  * My son now has a skateboard; maybe wet and icy weather isn&#8217;t the ideal time to learn to skateboard?
  * Three of the 4 people in my house go to school every day, and now that schools are closed to all but vulnerable children, we have 3 people at home on near-constant video calls. Which makes me suddenly very glad of that Powerline purchase.
  * The Christmas break was very welcome, and I could happily have many many weeks a year not working.
  * Johanna Rothman has finished her [Modern Management Made Easy book trilogy][3] &#8211; for me these are an easy day one purchase, since I’ve read [some of her other books][4] and they’ve been brilliant. Johanna also regularly talks at events (although mostly on American timezones) and will be on [the panel of the &#8220;Future of Agile&#8221; hosted by The Future of Work Scotland on 3 Feb 2021][5].
