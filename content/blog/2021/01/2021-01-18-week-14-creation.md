  * I turned 41. This is the test subject number assigned to Tetsuo in [Akira][1].
  * Building Lego is very therapeutic. This week I built Darth Vader’s TIE Advanced [from the (now retired) set which also came with an A-Wing][2] (and which I built when I first got the set a few years back).
  * Continuing the Star Wars theme I got a new [X-Wing/TIE fighter hoodie][3], which makes me happy.
  * “These dickheads are trying for the stars! The rest of us therefore need to make sure they don’t get there first.” &#8211; from [The Regrettable Decline of Space Utopias][4]
  * Trying to balance home schooling two children whilst also maintaining jobs is hard. 
  * My new [Hobonichi Techo journal][5] arrived! I did panic a bit when 1 January rolled around and I hadn’t ordered a new one; it pretty much runs my work life, and there’s something incredibly nice about its design and manufacture which make it just lovely to use. I’m not a journaller who draws pictures and sticks in stuff from their life, but as far as todo lists goes, it’s my fave.
  * I find I always publish my weeknotes &#8220;late&#8221; because I just resent going on my laptop at the weekend now, even though I use a different laptop for work in the week. Tiresome.
