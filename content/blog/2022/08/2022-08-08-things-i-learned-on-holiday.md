  1. My DVD rip of [The Devil Wears Prada][1] includes the closed-caption audio and not the regular audio
  2. A Chromebook is a perfectly reasonable development device using the built-in Linux support &#8211; git, Sublime Code and my particular build toolchain all worked fine
  3. [Portal][2] is actually quite good. Who knew?
  4. If you go to the [most middle-class service station in the UK][3] you can buy a terrible sandwich plushie for the low, low price of just Â£25 <figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
