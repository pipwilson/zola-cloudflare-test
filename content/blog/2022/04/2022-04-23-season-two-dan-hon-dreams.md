I don&#8217;t do newsletters, but [this is how][1] those [funky cool kids are naming their newsletters][2], so why not me?

After my stint at [Kaluza][3] helping them with their [Mission Transition][4] to help consumers reduce their energy usage in measured, sustainable ways I&#8217;ve started as Head of Engineering at [Macmillan Cancer Support][5] (by some counts [the most popular charity in the UK][6]).

Like many large orgs that have been around for a few decades they&#8217;ve got a healthy mix of legacy and modern applications, both in-house and outsourced, which has left them with a mixed take on their approach to managing their Digital Stuff* so part of my job is to tidy that up a bit, with frequent reference to [the Yak book][7].

This means it was existentially reassuring to read Dan Hon&#8217;s issue the other day [s11e31: Team Calculating Monster meets Team Wild Yak][8] which reminded me not of conversations I&#8217;ve had but ones that I perpetually fear having because that area is where Conversations And Paperwork lie and they are the bane of Getting Things Done, even when the Things that are Being Done aren&#8217;t actually as important as the Conversations And Paperwork, but it&#8217;s lovely to be able to tick something off your todo list sometimes, isn&#8217;t it?

Anyway, in other, more terrifying takes on the future is [this incredible demo of DALL-E integration with replit][9] which just reminds us all that when it comes to the Hyundai Boston Dynamics robotic warfare division, they&#8217;ll probably be working out whether they should kill, maim or just bury you under rubble using some training set they&#8217;ve obtained by downloading Twitch streams of tweens playing Call of Duty. Gotta love the future!
